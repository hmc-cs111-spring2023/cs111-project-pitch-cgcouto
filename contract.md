## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

In my time at Mudd, I've spent a lot of time learning hard CS skills. However, more subjective qualities of a CS project can be just as impactful on the quality of the final product. I really want to get out As a result, in-class and outside interview and user tests will be very useful for me. 

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

My plan is to write this as an external DSL, so I'm looking to work on my parsing skills. 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

My goal in scheduling work time for this project is to avoid crunch periods before notebook due dates on Sunday and before critique times on Monday. Working up against these deadlines would likely lead to work that is rushed and sub-optimal, and putting forth compromised work for critique distracts from . In addition, being tired from crunching Sunday and Monday may lead to poor critiques 

My Friday afternoons are really open, 

As for intermediate goals, I'd like to start by getting the engine working in my host language (probably Python). I really don't want to get bogged down by this, as the focus of this project is on the language design. As a result, if I don't have a basic implementation working within a week from this Sunday (by 4/2) I will pivot to writing a new interface for the first existing text-based game engine discussed in the *Related Work* section of my project.md file ().

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

First of all, I will always make sure to attend our classes on Monday so I can get that vital in-person time. It's hard to give good feedback if you're not there every time, being able to observe the full track for how their project has developed. I will also get hands-on experience working with their language if I can. That user testing will be useful to me for my critiques  

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

I would be proud to he's at a different college pursing a Game Development minor so I'd bet he'd get a kick out of it.

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

I'd like to define some extra stretch goals on top of what I've already outlined: 

* Support for ASCII images on certain triggers (such as entering a space or picking up an object) - would be loaded in similarly to how images are handled in Markdown
* Exceptional examples in my provided documentation - a good example of this would be implementing a chunk of an actual text-based adventure game from back in the day, I'm partial to *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* one.
* A debug mode that 

In my book, an A- or an A should go above what I laid out in my project.md file. I think that an A- would achieve at least one of the stretch goals I've outlined above, while an A would achieve three or more.
